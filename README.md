# Wine Quality Classification 

This projects aims to utilize wine data that is publicly available at UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality). There are a total of 10 numberical features in the dataset, and the target variable is a score for wine quality on a scale from 0-10. The data is biased towards wine with scores between 5-6, while there are very few cases with wine quality larger than 7. Furthermore, the numerical features of the data set exist on different scales and there is a precense of outliers as some wine types for example of have very large levels of residual sugar and free sulfur dioxide. In this project, the following tasks are done: 
- Exploration of the data set
- Feature engineering
